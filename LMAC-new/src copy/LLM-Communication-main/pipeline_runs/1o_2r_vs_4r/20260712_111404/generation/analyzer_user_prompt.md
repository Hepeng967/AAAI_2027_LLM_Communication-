Task and aligned observation description:
The map is 1o_2r_vs_4r. There is a large pit in the center of the map, dividing the battlefield into two sides. At the beginning of each episode, the Overseer and 2 Roaches spawn on one side, while 4 Reapers spawn on the other. The pit blocks direct movement and vision, so Roaches must rely on communication from the Overseer to locate and attack the Reapers. This scenario tests communication and coordination under significant terrain constraints.Observation information for map '1o_2r_vs_4r':
- Each agent observes a vector of length 49.
- There are 3 agents. Their types are: overseer, roach, roach.
- Each row of the observation corresponds to agent_id: [0, 1, 2], and their types: ['overseer', 'roach', 'roach'].
- The observation vector is composed as follows (index: feature):
    - 0: move_north
    - 1: move_south
    - 2: move_east
    - 3: move_west
    - 4: enemy_0_available
    - 5: enemy_0_distance
    - 6: enemy_0_rel_x

LMAC rollout observation alignment:
- Runtime LMAC observation vector length: 49.
- Documented SMAC observation vector length: 49.
- Rollout available: False from /data/hp/LLM_Communication/LMAC-new/data.
- Use runtime obs_shape for generated code and tests.
- Dimensions named lmac_extra_* are wrapper/config-added features; do not treat them as hidden global state.
